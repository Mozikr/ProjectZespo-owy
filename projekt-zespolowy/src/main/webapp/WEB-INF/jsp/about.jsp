      <h4 class="media-heading">My Story</h4>
      <p>From October 2020, I have been studying Computer Science at the WSB Merito in Wrocław, Poland. In my free time, I enjoy creating small games in Unity and learning programming languages such as C# and Java. I work on my own games, which I then share on platforms like Newgrounds and itch.io.
      During my spare time, I also engage in various physical activities, play games, and read. I am an organized, responsible person, full of enthusiasm for work and learning new skills. I am most interested in working with people who share my passion, from whom I can learn a lot, and creating things that others can enjoy and spend their free time with a smile on their face.</p>
